        <h1>About Crust</h1>
        <p>Crust was created in 2021 as a way to come up with at least nine different crust options on our order form. Now it's your neighborhood pizza joint - if your nieghborhood is just on the internet. You might be wondering: How can Crust make so many disparate styles of pizza? It's simple: you can order it, right? Someone (arguably a pizza lover) once said, "if it's not on the internet, it doesn't exist." We here at Crust have taken this to its logical conclusion. </p>
