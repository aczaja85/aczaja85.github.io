            <p>I used three rectangles to identify the first three riders in the image. Each rectangle directs the user to the particular rider's personal instagram account, where the user can find out more about that particular rider. I placed the link over each rider's face, as this this would be the logical place to look when wanting to identify someone. I did not include a rect for the fourth rider in view (the one on the far right) because they are not a contender in the stage.</p>
            <p>Circle tags are used to link the user to information regarding stage 9 of the Giro D'italia. Since the much of the attention of this stage had to do with the unique gravel stretch at the finish of the race, I used two circles on the gravel in the image. Viewers may be be wondering "Wow, what are they riding on?" and the viewer would be drawn to that part of the image. The link found in the bottom right corner will take them to a short video recap of the stage. The other link (placed at the bottom center of the image) will take users to the stage's profile and results on the Giro's official website. The final circle was place on Egan Bernal's right shoe and links to Sidi's (the shoe company's) website. Since Bernal won stage 9, and since it was arguably one of the toughest stages in the Giro, viewers might be curious about the products that powered this man to the finish line. Since a rider powers their bike through their pedals, a rider's shoe plays a significant role in this power transference.</p>
            <p>Finally, the poly shapes were used to help viewers identify the partiuclar bikes used by the rider's featured in the image. If someone clicks on the picture of the bike, it links them to the bike manufacturer's website. The poly shape allowed me to easily trace the entire image of each bike. </p>
